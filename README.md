Java Internship Task 10 – Exception Handling & Custom Exceptions

This project demonstrates:
- Runtime exception handling using try-catch-finally
- Custom unchecked exception creation
- Manual exception throwing using throw
- Validation of business rules
- Meaningful error messages and logging

This task helped me understand Java exception hierarchy and error handling best practices.
